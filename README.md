# Minecraft-Server-Port-Scanner
Minecraft Server Port Scanner very quickly scans ports on an IP address in an attempt to find more servers.

Minecraft Server Port Scanner is a blazing fast server scanner that is very similar to the Wurst server Finder.
MSPS utilizes (potentially unstable) multithreading to ensure very super high speed, with many settings for customization.

# Usage
To run, just double on the downloaded file, Also must have java installed. Any Java version between 8-17 will work.

**IP:** Take an ip from any server you already have in your list, you may get more results if it is a server from a hosting company, as they put many servers on the same IP.

**Start Port:** This box is the port that the scanning will start on. Port in general range from 0-65535, but most Minecraft servers will on port 20000-30000. Especially ports around 25565.

**Only Print Online Servers:** This is VERY recomended that you keep this checked. If this this isn't checked, it will print all servers that it pings, whether they are online or not, meaning that the output file will be filled with offline servers at the bottom, all of the online servers will be sorted to the top.

**Amount to Scan:** This will determine how many servers to scan, starting from the starting port. There isn't any recomended value, but it will take longer the more there are.

**Scan Speed:** This will determine how fast the program scans servers, the faster its set, the more CPU usage it will use. At "Dangerous" speed, it can scan aroud 1500 servers a second.
